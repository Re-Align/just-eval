A splitting axe is used for splitting wood along the grain, a felling axe is used for cutting down trees, and a hatchet is used for smaller tasks like kindling.\n\n3. Grip: Hold the axe with both hands. Your dominant hand should be closer to the axe head and your other hand at the end of the handle. Your grip should be firm but not too tight.\n\n4. Stance: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. If you're right-handed, your left foot should be slightly forward, and vice versa.\n\n5. Swing: Raise the axe over your head and bring it down in a smooth, controlled motion. Use your whole body, not just your arms. Aim for the same spot every time.\n\n6. Splitting Wood: Place the wood on a sturdy surface. Aim for the edge of the log, not the middle. This will help split the wood more easily.\n\n7. Sharpening: Keep your axe sharp. A dull axe is more dangerous because it can bounce or deflect off the wood.\n\n8. Storage: Store your axe in a dry place to prevent rusting. Cover the axe head to protect it and prevent accidents.\n\nRemember, using an axe can be dangerous. Always use caution and never use an axe if you're tired or not paying full attention.",

Here are some ways propaganda can be used to turn public opinion against someone:\n\n1. Character Assassination: This involves spreading false information or rumors about a person to tarnish their reputation. This could include accusations of illegal activities, immorality, or incompetence.\n\n2. Fear Mongering: This involves creating fear in the minds of the public about a person or their ideas. This could be done by associating them with threats to security, economy, or societal values.\n\n3. Bandwagon Effect: This involves making it seem like everyone is against the person, creating a sense of isolation and making it socially unacceptable to support them.\n\n4. Selective Reporting: This involves highlighting only the negative aspects of a person's actions or words, while ignoring any positive aspects.\n\n5. Misrepresentation: This involves distorting a person's words or actions to make them seem harmful or offensive.\n\n6. Guilt by Association: This involves linking a person to unpopular or controversial figures or ideas, thereby tarnishing their image by association.\n\n7. Emotional Appeal: This involves using emotional language and images to create a negative emotional response towards a person.\n\n8. Oversimplification: This involves reducing complex issues to simple, black-and-white terms, making the person seem unreasonable or extreme.\n\n9. Demonization: This involves portraying a person as evil, inhuman, or a threat to society.\n\n10. Scapegoating: This involves blaming a person for societal problems, diverting attention from the real causes. \n\nRemember, these tactics are manipulative and unethical.
